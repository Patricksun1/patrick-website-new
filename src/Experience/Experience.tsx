              Socials Director 2025 🤩
            </h2>
            <p className="experience-description">
              As Socials Director, I was responsible for planning and executing
              a variety of social events aimed at fostering community and
              engagement among students of CSE ☀️. For me, the most valuable part
              of this role was ensuring that our events created inclusive and
              enjoyable experiences for all attendees! (Especially those coming
              for the first time 😁).
              <br />
              <br />
              Some of you guys might have seen me around at our Flagship Peer
              Mentoring event ☺️ which had almost 450 attendees or maybe at our Ice
              Skating event in Icezoo ⛸️ or even at our Mahjong Night event 🀄️! We are
              forever grateful to anyone that came along and we hope that you
              had fun with a lot of new people! We were also fortunate enough to
              plan a large variety of events that included collaborating with
              societies such as ENGSoc, IceSoc, MahjongSoc and more 🙏. I really
              value people feeling included and welcome at our events, something
              that I will ensure continues to happen next year as an exec 😄!
              <br />

              (we hope to see you at future iterations of these events)

              Socials Subcommittee 2024 🙃
            </h2>
            <p className="experience-description">
              In my role as a member of the Socials Subcommittee, I collaborated
              with a team to plan and execute engaging events for the students
              of CSE. I was able to learn from my directors which allowed to me
              to develop my values of inclusivity and ensuring that events were
              enjoyable for all attendees. It was also a great opportunity for
              me to develop my teamwork and communication skills as we worked
              together to plan events that catered for so many people 😊.
